  static const String LvOnePassage = '\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBobby was preparing to go to bed late one evening when he heard a shrill screech coming from the barn outside. Bobby was unsure what was making such an eerie noise so late in the night. He had trouble falling asleep and tossed and turned all night dreaming about the haunting sounds emanating from the barn. When Bobby awakened the following morning, he hurried out to the barn to discover what was causing such a peculiar noise the night prior. He gathered his courage and entered the barn but left befuddled when he could not find what was making such noise. That evening after dinner as the sun was setting, Bobby grabbed a flashlight and set out for the barn. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“Where are you heading?” Bobby’s father asked. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“I am going to go find the monster that was making such a commotion last night,” Bobby replied. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“If you are going to look for a monster, you might need some assistance,” Bobby’s dad responded as he walked with Bobby out to the barn. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBobby shined his flashlight into the barn, but he did not see anything. Bobby called out but only his echo returned. He walked into the barn but there was no monster. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“What did this monster sound like?” Bobby’s dad asked. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“It was a screeching noise,” Bobby said, “and it was coming from the barn. I know it!” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBobby’s dad began to chuckle and he took the flashlight from Bobby. Shining the flashlight up at the roof of the barn, Bobby and his dad saw a small brown owl in the rafters of the roof. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“It was only a barn owl that you heard last night,” Bobby’s dad said. “They are nocturnal predators so that is why you only heard him at night. He must have been hunting for his dinner.” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBobby was elated that it wasn’t a monster and thanked his dad as they walked back to the house. Just then they heard a loud screech and looked up to see the barn owl flying away into the night sky. ';
  static const String LvTwoPassage = '\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"Now, Jo dear, the Chesters consider themselves very elegant people, so I want you to put on your best deportment. Don\'t make any of your abrupt remarks, or do anything odd, will you? Just be calm, cool, and quiet,—that\'s safe and ladylike; and you can easily do it for fifteen minutes," said Amy, as they approached the first place, having borrowed the white parasol and been inspected by Meg, with a baby on each arm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"Let me see. \'Calm, cool, and quiet,\'—yes, I think I can promise that. I\'ve played the part of a prim young lady on the stage, and I\'ll try it off. My powers are great, as you shall see; so be easy in your mind, my child."\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAmy looked relieved, but naughty Jo took her at her word; for, during the first call, she sat with every limb gracefully composed, every fold correctly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snowbank, and as silent as a sphinx. In vain Mrs. Chester alluded to her "charming novel," and the Misses Chester introduced parties, picnics, the opera, and the fashions; each and all were answered by a smile, a bow, and a demure "Yes" or "No," with the chill on. In vain Amy telegraphed the word "Talk," tried to draw her out, and administered covert pokes with her foot. Jo sat as if blandly unconscious of it all, with deportment like Maud\'s face, "icily regular, splendidly null."\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"What a haughty, uninteresting creature that oldest Miss March is!" was the unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies, as the door closed upon their guests. Jo laughed noiselessly all through the hall, but Amy looked disgusted at the failure of her instructions, and very naturally laid the blame upon Jo.';
  static const String LvThreePassage = '\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe departure of eight American athletes for the Olympic games is a notable event in American Athletics. Of the eight American representatives four, from the Boston Athletic Association, will represent American athletic clubs while four, from Princeton, will represent in a way the development of intercollegiate athletics in this country. It is probable that the Americans will bring back with them some prizes, to show what American pluck and skill and endurance can accomplish.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe revival of the Olympic games, after an interval of so many centuries, is due to a movement which began in 1894, at an international congress of athletic organizations, that congress being held in Paris under the auspices of the “Union of French Athletic Sports.” At the international congress the decision was made to limit all contests to amateur events, and if care is taken to exclude every element of professionalism in the games, there should be a number of new and noteworthy amateur records resultant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Greek people have taken hold of the movement enthusiastically; and while the modern Olympic games will naturally recognize the athletic rules and standards now in force, rather than those of ancient times, an effort will be made to copy many features of the old Grecian games. Thus, the old stadium at Athens has been restored at a heavy cost  and is to be used in its original dimensions, and it is there that most of the track events will be held: the bicycle races and the long distance run being naturally assigned to a longer course.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Probably one of the most interesting events of the games will be the long-distance run from Marathon to Athens; but there will also be all kinds of athletic sports, gymnastics, rifle shooting, and water events, from swimming races and “water football” to yachting and rowing races. Even such modern things as bicycle races, tennis, cricket and golf matches will be held,  and if the present revival of the games proves financially successful, it may be that the records of the new Olympic Games will surpass those of the ancient days.';
  static const String LvFourPassage = '\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe first flights with the power machine were made on December 17, 1903. Only five persons besides ourselves were present. These were Messrs. John T. Daniels, W. S. Dough, and A. D. Etheridge, of the Kill Devil Life-Saving Station; Mr. W. C. Brinkley, of Manteo; and Mr. John Ward, of Naghead. Although a general invitation had been extended to the people living within five or six miles, not many were willing to face the rigors of a cold December wind in order to see, as they no doubt thought, another flying machine not fly. The first flight lasted only 12 seconds, a flight very modest compared with that of birds, but it was, nevertheless, the first in the history of the world in which a machine carrying a man had raised itself by its own power into the air in free flight, had sailed forward on a level course without reduction of speed, and had finally landed without being wrecked. The second and third flights were a little longer, and the fourth lasted 59 seconds, covering a distance of 852 feet over the ground against a 20-mile wind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter the last flight the machine was carried back to camp and set down in what was thought to be a safe place. But a few minutes later, while we were engaged in conversation about the flights, a sudden gust of wind struck the machine, and started to turn it over. All made a rush to stop it, but we were too late. Mr. Daniels, a giant in stature and strength, was lifted off his feet, and falling inside, between the surfaces, was shaken about like a rattle in a box as the machine rolled over and over. He finally fell out upon the sand with nothing worse than painful bruises, but the damage to the machine caused a discontinuance of experiments.';
